Text Mining Project Retake - Binary Classification Focus
Welcome to my repository for the retake of the text mining project. In this second iteration, I've taken a different approach by shifting the focus of my project. Previously, I found myself hitting a plateau with the labs and decided it was time for a change.

I have redirected my efforts towards binary classification, with a particular emphasis on class balancing techniques such as oversampling and undersampling. I believe this change is judicious for several reasons. Firstly, it remains within the same sphere of text mining and natural language processing. Secondly, these techniques are highly relevant and applicable to my previous topic, providing a continuous thread between the two projects.

This project centers on the classification of fake job advertisements. Working on fake job ad detection has been an enlightening experience. It's a subject of significant importance that can prevent widespread scams, protecting countless individuals from being victimized. Given the surge in mass data collection via fraudulent job ads, it's a topic that not only commands attention but also demands action. The repercussions of such scams are severe, with potential consequences including years of imprisonment and fines reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars.

I hope that the code and insights shared here will contribute to the ongoing discourse and efforts in combating these fraudulent activities. Your feedback and contributions are welcome, as we collectively advance towards more secure and trustworthy job-seeking environments.
